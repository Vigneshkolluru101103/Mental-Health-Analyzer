# 🧠 Mental-Health-Analyzer

🚀 **Live Demo:** [Click here to try the application!](https://mental-health-analyzer-dpqszzfzrzrleepufyoi7h.streamlit.app/)

**Description:**  
Classifies mental health status from text (sentence) using a BERT-based NLP model. Supports both single text input and batch CSV predictions with probability visualization. The model is trained on mental health-related text datasets and predicts categories like Anxiety, Depression, Stress, etc Achieving 90% accuracy.

**Dataset Details:**  
- **Source:** Public mental health datasets from social media posts, forums, or research datasets.  
- **Number of samples:** ~50,000+ 
- **Classes:**  
   - Normal
   - Depression
   - Suicidal
   - Anxiety
   - Stress
   - Bi-Polar
   - Personality Disorder

## 🧹 Preprocessing Steps
Before training, the text data was cleaned and prepared to ensure high-quality inputs for the BERT model:

1. **Lowercasing** – All text converted to lowercase for uniformity.
2. **URL & Mention Removal** – Removed links, mentions (`@user`), and hashtags.
3. **Special Characters & Extra Spaces** – Cleaned unnecessary symbols, emojis, and redundant whitespace.
4. **Stopword Handling** – Removed common stopwords while retaining meaning-relevant words.
5. **Lemmatization** – Reduced words to their base or dictionary form to improve generalization.
6. **Class Balancing** – Applied oversampling and text augmentation to handle minority mental health classes.
7. **Train-Validation-Test Split** – Dataset divided into **70% training**, **15% validation**, and **15% testing** for robust model evaluation.


**Key Features:**  
- Achieves ~90% accuracy on mental health-related text.
- can Detect sarcasm at some extent.
- Visualize prediction probabilities for better insights(Depression and Suicidal are close meaning).

**Usage:**  
1. **Install required packages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the Streamlit app:**
```
streamlit run app.py
```


**Notes:**
- Ensure you have installed the required packages from requirements.txt.
- The model will be saved to the specified path in download_model.py and used by the app for inference.

## Limitations of the Model

### 1. Domain-Specific Data (small scope)
- The model is trained on specific mental health datasets, such as [Kaggle’s Mental Health Sentiment dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health).  
- Performance may degrade on text from other domains, languages, or platforms not seen during training.

### 2. Limited Class Coverage
- Currently predicts only the predefined classes: Anxiety, Bipolar, Depression, Normal, Personality Disorder, Stress, Suicidal.  
- Does not account for other mental health conditions or nuanced emotional states.

### 3. Ambiguous or Sarcastic Text
- The model detects sarcasm at some extent but may fail to correctly classify sarcasm, humor, or ambiguous statements.

### 4. Language Limitation
- Trained primarily on English text; performance on other languages or heavily informal/slang text may be poor.

## Most Imp : 
    it need 2-3 line sentence to understand context better.
### Example : 
- "i am giving up."
     ```may predict normal```
- "I’ve tried everything I could think of, but nothing works. Honestly, I feel like I’m giving up on everything."
    - ```understands NLP and predict Depression/sucidal```
